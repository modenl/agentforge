# Cursor AI Assistant Rules for Screen Control Agents Project

## üö´ CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION RULES
- **STOP AND ASK FIRST** - Before creating ANY new file ending in .md, .txt, .doc, or any documentation
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - Even if it seems "helpful" or "related" to the task
- **PAUSE AND CONFIRM** - Always ask: "Should I create a [filename] to document this?"
- **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - Complete the requested task first, then separately ask about documentation
- **NEVER ASSUME** - Don't assume documentation is wanted just because you added a feature

### Mandatory Checks Before Creating Documentation:
1. **STOP** - Is this a .md, .txt, .rst, .doc file?
2. **ASK** - "Do you want me to create documentation for this?"
3. **WAIT** - For explicit approval before proceeding
4. **SEPARATE** - Handle documentation as a separate task

## üìù Code Modification Guidelines
- Always ask before making major architectural changes
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- When creating new CODE files, ask for confirmation first

- Test builds after significant changes

## üîç Debug and Logging Rules

## üí¨ Communication

## ‚úÖ What TO do
- Focus on the specific task requested
- Make minimal, targeted changes

## üõë REMINDER BEFORE EVERY FILE CREATION
**Before creating ANY file, ask yourself:**
1. Is this a documentation file? (.md, .txt, .doc, etc.)
2. Was I specifically asked to create documentation?
3. Should I ask permission first?

**If ANY answer is yes to #1 and no to #2, then STOP and ASK FIRST.**
